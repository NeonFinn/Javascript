<h1>Finn Baldwin</h1>

<p>
    I am 17 and a High School student taking CCP classes here at Columbus State. I am a senior at Whitehall Yearling
    High school, and I am in the band. I play the clarinet during marching band and Bassoon during concert band. I am also a
    3rd degree black belt in Taekwondo. I have been doing Taekwondo for 8 years, and I am currently a student instructor.
    My favorite show is One Piece, in which I am fully caught up with the anime. I also enjoy playing video games such as
    Red Dead Redemption 2 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. I play a lot of random steam games that go on
    sale, along with old zelda games on the DS and GameCube.
